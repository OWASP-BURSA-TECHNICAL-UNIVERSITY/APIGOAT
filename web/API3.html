    <h1>API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This category combines API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure and API6:2019 - Mass Assignment, focusing on the root cause: the lack of or improper authorization validation at the object property level. This leads to information exposure or manipulation by unauthorized parties.

        <h2>LAB Scenario</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Context:</h5>
        <p>
            A social media application has an API endpoint to retrieve user profiles: GET /users/{userID}
            The API endpoint returns a JSON object containing various user properties like name, email address, public posts, and a private field - "isAdmin" (indicating admin privileges).
        </p>
        <h5>Broken Authorization:</h5>
        <p>
            The API endpoint returns all user properties regardless of the requesting user's permissions.
            There's no check to see if the requesting user has the privilege to access the "isAdmin" property.
        </p>
        <h5>Attack Scenario:</h5>
        <p>
            Regular User Observation:
            A regular user, Ben, observes how the social media application displays user profiles.
            Property Identification: Ben notices that the profile URLs follow a pattern and might include the "isAdmin" property in the response though it's not displayed on the user interface.
            Unauthorized Access Attempt: Ben constructs a URL like GET /users/{adminID} replacing {adminID} with an administrator's ID. If Broken Object Property Level Authorization exists, the API response will include the "isAdmin" property, revealing whether that user has admin privileges.
        </p>
        <h5>Impact:</h5>
        <p>
            Ben can potentially identify administrator accounts within the social media platform. This information could be used for further attacks like social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities specific to administrator accounts.        </p>
        <h5>Mitigation:</h5>
        <p>
            The API endpoint should implement authorization checks on individual properties within the user object.
            It should only return properties that the requesting user has permission to access. In this case, the "isAdmin" property should be omitted from the response for non-admin users.
