    <h1>API7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws can occur when an API is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URI. This enables an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall or a VPN.

        <h2>LAB Scenario</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Context:</h5>
        <p>
            A weather forecasting company offers an API to retrieve weather data for different locations: GET /weather?location={city}
        </p>
        <h5>Vulnerable API Design:</h5>
        <p>
            The API endpoint blindly trusts the user-provided location parameter {city}.
            The server fetches weather data from an internal weather service based on the requested location.
            No validation or restrictions are placed on the location parameter.    
        </p>
        <h5>Attack Scenario:</h5>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attacker Discovery: An attacker, Mallory, discovers the weather API and its functionalities.</li>
            <li>SSRF Vulnerability Identification: Through testing and observation, Mallory recognizes the API might be susceptible to SSRF attacks because it fetches data based on user input.</li>
            <li>Crafting Malicious Request: Mallory constructs a request with the location parameter {city} set to a URL pointing to an internal server resource of the weather forecasting company, for instance, a vulnerability scanner or a resource that exposes sensitive information.</li>
        </ol>   
        </p>
        <h5>Impact:</h5>
        <p>
            If the SSRF vulnerability exists, the weather forecasting company's server will unknowingly make a request to the internal URL specified by Mallory. This could potentially allow Mallory to:

            Scan Internal Network:
        
            The internal server response might reveal information about the company's internal network infrastructure or applications.
            Exfiltrate Sensitive Data: If the internal URL points to a vulnerable resource, Mallory might be able to steal sensitive data like user information or company secrets.
            Launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: Repeated SSRF requests targeting critical internal resources could overload the server and cause a DoS attack, disrupting normal operations.       
        </p>
        <h5>Mitigation:</h5>
        <p>
            implement validation on the location parameter. Restrict allowed characters and prevent users from specifying URLs or internal network paths.
            Consider whitelisting specific locations or using a predefined list of valid locations to limit the scope of data retrieval.
            Sanitize the location parameter to remove potentially malicious code or characters that could be used for SSRF attacks.        
        </p>
