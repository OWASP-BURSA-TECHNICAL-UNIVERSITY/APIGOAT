    <h1>API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        APIs vulnerable to this risk expose a business flow - such as buying a ticket, or posting a comment - without compensating for how the functionality could harm the business if used excessively in an automated manner. This doesn't necessarily come from implementation bugs.
    </p>

        <h2>LAB Scenario</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Context:</h5>
        <p>
            A travel booking platform offers an API for various travel booking functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET /flights: Search for flights based on travel criteria. (Public function)</li>
            <li>POST /bookings: Create a new flight booking. (Authenticated user function)</li>
            <li>UT /bookings/{bookingID}: Update an existing booking. (Authorized user function)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Unrestricted Access and Business Logic Abuse:</h5>
        <p>
            The API allows booking flight tickets but lacks safeguards to prevent abuse of the booking workflow. There are no restrictions on the number of bookings a user can create or modify within a specific timeframe.
        </p>
        <h5>Attack Scenario:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Attacker Observation: An attacker, Mallory, observes the travel booking platform and understands the general booking process.</li>
            <li>Business Logic Exploitation: Mallory realizes there are no limits on booking creation. She can exploit this logic to manipulate flight availability and potentially disrupt the platform's operations.</li>
            <li>Mass Booking and Cancellation: Mallory develops a script to automate booking a large number of seats on popular flights close to the departure date. This could significantly reduce seat availability for legitimate users.</li>
            <li>Cancellation at the Last Minute: Shortly before the flight, Mallory cancels all the mass bookings she made. Airlines typically release cancelled seats back for sale at a discounted price.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Impact:</h5>
        <p>
            Mallory's actions can artificially inflate demand and limit seat availability for genuine travelers seeking flights.
            Last-minute cancellations can cause airlines to lose revenue as they might have to discount seats to fill the flight.
            The platform's reputation could be damaged due to unreliable booking experiences for legitimate users.
        </p>
        <h5>Mitigation:</h5>
        <p>
            Implement controls to restrict the number of bookings a user can create within a specific timeframe.
            Analyze booking behavior for anomalies and suspicious patterns. This could help identify attempts to mass-book and cancel flights.
            Consider introducing additional verification steps for bookings exceeding a certain threshold.        </p>
