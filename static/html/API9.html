    <h1>API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, making proper and updated documentation highly important. A proper inventory of hosts and deployed API versions also are important to mitigate issues such as deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints.
    </p>

        <h2>LAB Scenario</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Context:</h5>
        <p>
            A large organization develops and uses various internal APIs for different departments.
            There's no centralized registry or documentation for all APIs within the organization.
        </p>
        <h5>Improper Inventory Management:</h5>
        <p>
            The organization lacks a proper inventory of APIs. Many APIs are undocumented, and their existence is only known to a small group within specific departments.
            No clear ownership or lifecycle management is established for these APIs.
        </p>
        <h5>Attack Scenario-1:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Internal Actor Negligence (Unintentional): A developer working on a new project stumbles upon an undocumented API endpoint while investigating the network traffic. Due to lack of documentation, the purpose and security posture of the API are unclear.</li>
            <li>Accidental Misuse: Without proper understanding, the developer decides to integrate with the undocumented API in their new project. This could lead to unintended consequences: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Exposure: The undocumented API might expose sensitive data that the new project shouldn't access.</li>
                    <li>Broken Functionalities: Integrating with an outdated or unsupported API could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior in the new project.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Attack Scenario-2:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Internal Actor Negligence (Malicious): An employee with malicious intent discovers an old, forgotten API endpoint through network scanning or social engineering. There's no record of this API, and its functionalities are unknown.</li>
            <li>Exploiting a Shadow API: The malicious actor experiments with the forgotten API and discovers a vulnerability due to its outdated nature. They exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities within the organization's systems.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Impact:</h5>
        <p>
            Improper inventory management can lead to several negative consequences:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security Risks: Undocumented APIs create blind spots, making them vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. These attackers might be external or even malicious actors within the organization.</li>
            <li>Integration Issues: Integrating with undocumented APIs can lead to development delays and compatibility problems in new projects.</li>
            <li>Compliance Issues: Lack of API inventory makes it difficult to demonstrate compliance with security regulations or internal governance policies.</li>
        </ul>
               
        <h5>Mitigation:</h5>
        <p>
            Implement a centralized API registry to document all APIs, including their purpose, functionalities, ownership, and access controls.
            Enforce clear API lifecycle management practices, including development, deployment, versioning, deprecation, and retirement of APIs.
            Foster a culture of API awareness within the organization. Encourage developers to document their APIs and report any undocumented APIs they encounter.
            Regularly review and update the API inventory to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
