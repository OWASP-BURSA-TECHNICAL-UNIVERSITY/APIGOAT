    <h1>API2:2023 - Broken Authentication</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising a system's ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall.

        <h2>LAB Scenario</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Context:</h5>
        <p>
            A web application uses a simple username and password login system for API access.
            Passwords are stored in plain text or with weak hashing algorithms.
            There's no multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented.
        </p>
        <h5>Broken Authorization:</h5>
        <p>
            The API endpoint relies solely on the fileID parameter in the URL.
            It fails to check if the currently logged-in user (through mechanisms like JWT tokens) has permission to access the specific file.
        </p>
        <h5>Attack Scenario:</h5>
        <p>
            Credential Stealing: An attacker, Mallory, sniffs network traffic between the application and the server. Mallory intercepts a login request containing Alice's username and password (in plain text due to insecure transmission).
            Brute-Force Attack (Optional): If passwords are not adequately hashed, Mallory can use a brute-force attack tool to try a large number of password combinations against known usernames like Alice's.
            Unauthorized Access: Mallory can use the stolen credentials (or cracked password) to make unauthorized API requests and potentially access Alice's account data or perform actions on her behalf.
        </p>
        <h5>Impact:</h5>
        <p>
            Mallory could steal sensitive user information, manipulate data, or impersonate Alice to perform unauthorized actions within the application        </p>
        <h5>Mitigation:</h5>
        <p>
            Implement strong password hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) to protect stored credentials.
            Enforce secure transmission protocols (HTTPS) to encrypt communication between the application and the server.
            Limit login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
            Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security during login.
